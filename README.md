# The Haukai Restaurant Web Application
The project involved designing and building an interactive and mobile-friendly web application based on a case study of a fictitious client, The Haukai Restaurant. 

The restaurant wanted a web presence to attract more customers and make staff more productive by providing an online booking submission option that would free up their time taking phone bookings. They also wanted customers to be aware of their opening hours and needed a way for staff to access their work rosters online without needing to ring the owners ahead of time. The restaurant was a new business looking for affordable development options and needed a way to market the website to non-local visitors.

The project was completed over 3 assessments whilst completing the Web Development course at Open Polytechnic NZ as part of the Web Development and Design diploma. The web application was built with HTML5, CSS and JavaScript code. The staff information page is protected with authentication by using a .htaccess and .htpasswd file on the server. Unfortunately, the GitHub server does not allow this functionality to work when deployed to GitHub Pages. Therefore, users will be able to access this page without authentication.

# Improvements / Enhancements
Content could be displayed next to the restaurant photo on large screens to make better use of the space, thereby making the image smaller and allowing the image to fit above the fold of the screen.
